`@newswire/scroller` is a super-tiny library for your scrollytelling needs.

## Heads up!

`@newswire/scroller` will continue to work great, but I've written a semi-successor to it as a custom element called [`scroll-scene-element`](https://github.com/rdmurphy/scroll-scene-element) that I encourage you to check out! Both are great options for building out your scrollytelling projects.

## Key features

- üêú **Less than 600 bytes** gzipped
- üëÄ Uses a highly-performant **[Intersection Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)** to monitor scrolling changes
- üôÖüèΩ‚Äç **No dependencies** (unless you need an [**Intersection Observer** polyfill](#intersection-observer-polyfill) - [check what browsers you support](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver)!)

## Examples

- [Basic](https://rdmurphy.github.io/scroller/basic)
- [Sticky graphic](https://rdmurphy.github.io/scroller/sticky)

## Installation

`@newswire/scroller` is available via `npm`.

```sh
npm install @newswire/scroller
```

You can also use it directly via [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com/).

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@newswire/scroller/dist/index.umd.js"></script>
<!-- Now available at `window.Scroller` -->
```

You can also import it as a module via unpkg!

```html
<script type="module">
  import Scroller from 'https://unpkg.com/@newswire/scroller/dist/index.mjs';

  const scroller = new Scroller({
    scenes: document.querySelectorAll('.scene'),
  });
</script>
```

## Usage

Assume for the following examples that our HTML is as follows:

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="scene"></div>
  <div class="scene"></div>
  <div class="scene"></div>
  <div class="scene"></div>
  <div class="scene"></div>
</div>
```

To begin tracking the progression of the scenes, we need to set up our `Scroller`.

```js
import Scroller from '@newswire/scroller';

// sets up the scroller instance, pass in an array of all the scenes
const scroller = new Scroller({
  scenes: document.querySelectorAll('.scene'),
});

// Scroller has a tiny event emitter embedded in it!

// the `enter` event is triggered every time a scene crosses the threshold
scroller.on('scene:enter', d => {
  d.element.classList.add('active');
});

// the `exit` event is triggered every time a scene exits the threshold
scroller.on('scene:exit', d => {
  d.element.classList.remove('active');
});

scroller.on('init', () => {
  console.log('Everything is ready to go!');
});

// starts up the IntersectionObserver
scroller.init();
```

If you need to additionally track the "container" of your scenes, `Scroller` can track and alert you about that too.

```js
import Scroller from '@newswire/scroller';

// sets up the scroller instance, pass in the container and an array of all the scenes
const scroller = new Scroller({
  container: document.querySelector('.container'),
  scenes: document.querySelectorAll('.scene'),
});

// the `enter` event works as you expect with scenes...
scroller.on('scene:enter', d => {
  d.element.classList.add('active');
});

scroller.on('scene:exit', d => {
  d.element.classList.remove('active');
});

// ...but if a container is passed, events fire for it as well!
scroller.on('container:enter', d => {
  console.log("Let's go!");
});

scroller.on('container:exit', d => {
  console.log('We are done here.');
});

scroller.init();
```

## Intersection Observer's pre-check

This is a minor quirk of Intersection Observer to keep in mind. Whenever an element gets added to an Intersection Observer instance it is immediately checked for intersection. In the context of `Scroller`, this means that if it is instantiated on load of a page and none of its elements are currently intersecting, `scene:exit` (and possibly `container:exit`) is going to fire for each element as they fail that initial check. The good thing is this is _also_ true for the `*:enter` events, so nothing special is necessary for detecting if someone loads in the middle of your interactive. Make sure the code in your event listeners are prepared for this and have some way to determine whether anything in your `*:exit` listeners are needed yet!

## Intersection Observer polyfill?

To keep the library lean, `@newswire/scroller` intentionally does not attempt to polyfill `IntersectionObserver` and leaves that task up to the user if necessary. Browser support is [pretty good](https://caniuse.com/#feat=intersectionobserver)! There's no hard and fast rule here - check what browsers your users are using and make a call.

There are a few good ways to ensure the polyfill is in place.

### Load it within your bundle

The spec-based Intersection Observer polyfill is [available on `npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/intersection-observer).

```sh
npm install intersection-observer
```

Once that is installed, you need to make sure that it is loaded before any code that'd depends on it will run. The polyfill is smart - it won't affect browsers who already have support!

```js
import 'intersection-observer';
// or
require('intersection-observer');

// your awesome code here!
```

### Load it with [`polyfill.io`](https://polyfill.io/v3/)

Before loading your scripts, you can include a link to [`polyfill.io`](https://polyfill.io/v3/). This service uses signals from the browser to determine what polyfills are needed and loads them in the environment. You can set flags on the URL to limit what `polyfill.io` attempts to load.

```html
<!-- "nomodule" is used to prevent this from loading in modern browers, which almost certainly
support IntersectionObserver -->
<script nomodule src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=IntersectionObserver"></script>
<script src="<your-code>"></script>
```

### Load it with [`unpkg.com`](https://unpkg.com)

This is similar to the `polyfill.io` method, but without a service in-between determining whether it is necessary.

```html
<!-- "nomodule" is used to prevent this from loading in modern browers, which almost certainly
support IntersectionObserver -->
<script nomodule src="https://unpkg.com/intersection-observer/intersection-observer"></script>
<script src="<your-code>"></script>
```

### Scroller

Uses Intersection Observer to monitor the page location of a series of
elements for scrollytelling.

#### Parameters

  - `options.container` **[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element)?** Optionally pass in what should be
    considered the containing element of all the scenes - this gets added to the

  - `options.offset` **[Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number)?** How far from the top/bottom of the viewable
    area to trigger enters/exits of scenes, represented as a value between
    0 and 1 (optional, default `0.5`)
  - `options.scenes` **[Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)&lt;[Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Element)>** An array of all the Elements to be
    considered scenes of this Scroller

});

scroller.init();
